Mirror setup for openvz.org
=========================

This Git repository provides the according information
and configuration as used by the [OpenVZ](https://openvz.org/) project
and its mirror infrastructure.

If you want to provide an OpenVZ mirror you should setup it according to
[instruction](https://openvz.org/Setting_up_a_mirror).
Your mirror site should make the contents of this directory available
via HTTP, FTP or rsync protocols.

Please take a look at the file [mirrors.masterlist]() in this repository
to see what kind of information we'd need from you.
Then we can integrate your mirror into our mirroring infrastructure, including the download.grml.org GeoIP balancer.

The status of OpenVZ mirror infrastructure can be checked at [mirror.openvz.org](http://mirror.openvz.org/).

Thanks for your interest and help in providing an OpenVZ mirror!
